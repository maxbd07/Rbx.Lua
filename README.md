# Rbx.Lua
Place to post some of my Rbx.Lua scripts for Roblox exploiting or just normal Roblox scripting.


08-09-2021 EDIT: I've been away from the exploiting community for quite awhile (don't know if I'm coming back), so I don't know how much of this stuff is outdated. Also my scripting style has changed since the last time I updated these so I should probably apologize for the cringe lazy variable naming. Although I do think it still kind of looks nice. I'm not planning on updating them unless I come back in the future, you can if you want to.
